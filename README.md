# Thorn-AME-Gboard
I put these Gboard dictionary files together to make using thorn(and eth if you want) easy in your everyday typing(if you use Gboard)

To import dictionary:
  Simply download the dictionary of your choice(TH-dict.txt for only thorn, TH-DH-dict.txt for both thorn and eth)
  
    It's easiest to import if you upload to Google Drive
  Import the file into Gboard:
  
    For Android:
      Settings > System > Keyboard > On-screen keyboard > Gboard > Dictionary > Personal Dictionary > English > â‹® > Import
      This should open Google Drive automatically; navigate to the dictionary file and click it to open
To use:
  Simply write words as usual, clicking the suggestions that pop up at the top of the keyboard when you type words with 'th'
  -or-
  Use an Icelandic keyboard with multilingual typing enabled, using thorn and/or eth, which will no longer be autocorrected or considered incorrect

Enjoy ressurecting thorn!
  (and eth if you want)
